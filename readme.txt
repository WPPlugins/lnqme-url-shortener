This plugin replaces the default WordPress shortlinks with LNQ.me shortlinks. 

== Description ==

WordPress generates shortlinks for your posts and pages. By default it uses the `?p=` with the post ID added to it, but if you have a rather long domain name this isn't very useful. This plugin will help you: it replaces the shortlink WordPress generates with a proper LNQ.me shortlink.
